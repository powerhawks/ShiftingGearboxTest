# ShiftingGearboxTest
This is testing code for the drive train and shifting gearbox. Part of the code is experimental for testing the 3-position gearbox, however that logic is commented out in TeleopPeriodic so only the current 2-position system is handled. 
Test only this code when working on the drive train and gearbox.
